##
## This project will be a test driven development
##
## Which basically means it obey the LAWs that:
##      1. You may not write production code until you have a failing unit test. 
##      2. You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail. (note: compiling is also a test)
##      3. You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the current test. 


This project is to rewrite and enhance the original code (basically low-level control with lots of critical flaw and fault).

The goal is to build a conprehensive software system for the arm including:

1. low-level comprehensive control:
    involve basic functionality, safety, debugging, and interfacing.

2. Client UI code:
    interfacing with low-level code to have easy debugging and testing

3. ROS integration:
    integration code with ROS
